          Second lesson at "cursuscentrum Marco" starting to design a page for the memory game we are learning to develop.
          Using grids and bootstrap. How do the programmes Marco advised work together, which part do I use to do what.
              Felling myself very "bewust onbekwaam" but loving it, I am learning and I see I have a lot te learn. </p>

First lesson at "cursuscentrum Marco" Today I worked on clearing my page from the generated HTML and CSS codes and define the content ans layout of my page myself.
starting to get to know CSS and how to tell the browser where to look. And also learning which programmes to use to write the code. 
Most important lesson: this is NOT notepad ;) </p>

My first steps back into coding.
Under the great and supportive supervision of my dear friend Marco (<a href="https://github.com/McBeelen" class="user-mention">@McBeelen</a>).
Today I created my GitHub page using the automatic generator. 
Just to find out how it works.
My goal is to code myself, and use as little generators as needed.</p>
