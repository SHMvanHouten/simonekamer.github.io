First lesson at "cursuscentrum Marco" Today I worked on clearing my page from the generated HTML and CSS codes and define the content ans layout of my page myself.
starting to get to know CSS and how to tell the browser where to look. And also learning which programmes to use to write the code. 
Most important lesson: this is NOT notepad ;) </p>

My first steps back into coding.
Under the great and supportive supervision of my dear friend Marco (<a href="https://github.com/McBeelen" class="user-mention">@McBeelen</a>).
Today I created my GitHub page using the automatic generator. 
Just to find out how it works.
My goal is to code myself, and use as little generators as needed.</p>
